# Data-Visualization-All about Data
Introduction

This website is constructed with R-language on a RShiny platform, essentially containing some of my self-motivated works about data analytics in various topics. I have a college background in finance when studying at NCCU in Taiwan while I was interested in analyzing financial data in a quantitative manner, and this was why I continued my master degree in statistics where I could learn more techniques for quantitative modeling. Thereof, I found it fascinating in data analysis in a broader range of fields not just limited to financial data. My goal is to apply whatever techniques that I've learned which are also popular in modern data analysis to hands-on experience in various topics, most importantly, visualizing the data or modeling results for story-telling, and manage to use 'understandable' language to introduce abstract methodologies to people who are not specialized in these. The webpage basically consists of three major section: Finance, Statistics and Other topics. For each major section, you can find correspondent subtitle and the correspondent techniques used with brief introduction. Thank you for visiting!:<br/>
